	const introductionMD = `## What is Vibinex?
Vibinex helps you understand the changes in your codebase.
Vibinex helps you:
- Get your pull request merged quickly
- Understand the changes in a pull request faster and better
- Reduce the average time to first review by 50%
`

	const featuresMD = `### Features
1. **Relevant Reviewers Comment**: Vibinex automatically identifies the relevant reviewers for your pull request and publishes the list of reviewers in the pull request as a comment, establishing it as common knowledge.
2. **Automatic Review Assignment**: Vibinex automatically assigns the relevant team members as reviewers to your pull request.
3. **Highlighted Changes**: Vibinex highlights the file names and the changes in your pull request that you have previously worked on and understand deeply.
4. **Highlighted Pull Requests**: Vibinex highlights the pull requests that have changes relevant to you from the list of pull requests on the repository.

You can choose to turn on/off each feature individually.
There are **Feature Flags** on the [Vibinex settings page](https://vibinex.com/settings) to turn the PR comment or the automatic review assignment on or off.
The highlighting features are delivered through the [Chrome extension](${CHROME_EXTENSION_LINK}), which you can disable if you don't want to see the highlights.
`
	const architectureMD = `### Architecture
The diagram below describes the architecture of Vibinex. It consists of 3 components:
3. [Vibinex DPU](https://github.com/vibinex/vibi-dpu): Marked as the "Backend #1" in the below diagram, the DPU (Data Processing Unit) is docker container the processes your code. It has no public endpoints for maximum privacy & security.
2. [Vibinex server](https://github.com/vibinex/vibinex-server): Marked as the "Backend #2" in the below diagram, the server is the main backend of Vibinex. It triggers the DPU when a PR is created or changed and acts as the backend for the browser extension.
1. [Vibinex Browser extension](https://github.com/vibinex/chrome-extension): It modifies the GitHub/Bitbucket UI to show the highlighted PRs and file changes to help you better navigate and understand the changes in your pull request.

![Vibinex Architecture](${architecturalDiagram(theme)})

#### What is a DPU?
A DPU stands for Data Processing Unit. It is a docker container that processes all the sensitive data, i.e. your codebase. Self-hosting the DPU on your own VMs provides the highest privacy.
`

	const setupMD = `### Setup steps
There are just 2 steps to setting up Vibinex:
1. Setup the DPU
2. Install the browser extension

You can set up the DPU on your repositories either as an owner of the repository or a member. When you set it up as an owner, webhooks are added on your repository that automatically trigger DPU when a pull request is created or updated. When you set it up as a member, you need to manually trigger the DPU when a pull request when you want to process it.

Follow [this guide](/docs/setup/providerLogin) for a quick set up.
